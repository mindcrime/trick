Verification simulation of monte_carlo.


The following tests rely on setting the directories to be non-writable.  Their
purpose is to detect situations in which the monte-carlo model cannot generate
certain files. These tests by their very nature are difficult to run within an
automated scripted testing system.

  IO_FAIL
  IO_RUN_ERROR1
  IO_RUN_ERROR2


The following cases are expecting either a warning or an error but
the simulation does not terminate. Instead, ZERO is returned.
The purpose of these cases is to emit the error or warning, not generate
viable datasets. Do not evaluate any of these cases for good dispersions.
There is no telling what state the data is in after the warning / error
message is emitted.

  RUN_ERROR_file_inconsistent_skip
  RUN_ERROR_invalid_call
  RUN_ERROR_invalid_name
  RUN_ERROR_invalid_sequence
  RUN_ERROR_invalid_sequencing
  RUN_ERROR_IO_error
  RUN_ERROR_IO_error2
  RUN_ERROR_out_of_domain_error
  RUN_ERROR_random_value_truncation
  RUN_WARN_config_error
  RUN_WARN_invalid_name
  RUN_WARN_overconstrained_config


The following cases emit a fatal error and the simulation halts in its tracks:

  FAIL_config_error
  FAIL_duplicate_variable
  FAIL_illegal_config
  FAIL_invalid_config
  FAIL_invalid_data_file
  FAIL_IO_error
  FAIL_IO_error2
  FAIL_malformed_data_file
